- **Prompt Engineering**: Healthcare-specific system prompts for medical terminology
- **Context-Aware Translation**: Domain-specific translation with healthcare context
- **Fallback System**: Mock translation for development/testing

### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// AI Service Configuration
const aiConfig = {
  model: 'llama3-8b-8192',
  maxTokens: 1024,
  temperature: 0.1,  // Low temperature for consistent medical translations
  context: 'healthcare'
};

// Prompt Engineering
const systemPrompt = `You are an expert translator specializing in ${context} terminology. 
Translate the user's text from ${sourceLang} to ${targetLang}. 
Provide only the direct translation, with no additional explanations.`;
```
